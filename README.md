**A personal iMessage assistant that can use a browser like you.**

It can do your chores, book you movie tickets, or handle your groceries.
You stay in control of your passwords, credit cards and context.

It's Open Source, self-hostable, and can use any model.
One-click deploy to Vercel and get rolling.

## Why self-host?

Personal agents are much more useful when they can sign in, book, buy and act
on your behalf. But your accounts, your passwords, are the keys to your digital
kingdom. OpenInstinct runs in your own Vercel account. Secrets are encrypted
before they touch your database and models never see them. Verify yourself by
reading the code!

## Deployment

The deploy flow provisions everything: [Kernel](https://kernel.sh) for cloud
browsers, [Neon](https://neon.tech) for Postgres, [Linq](https://linq.app) for
the iMessage line, and Vercel AI Gateway for inference. Usage is billed to your
Vercel account. Set the remaining auth variables on the deployment:

```bash
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://your-host
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/database
DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=postgresql://user:password@host/database
SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

The application database schema and versioned migrations live in `db/`. The
Drizzle application store uses `DATABASE_URL` for runtime queries; its migration
commands require the direct `DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED` connection. Run
`pnpm db:migrate` before starting against a new or upgraded local database.
Vercel uses Turbo to run the uncached migration task before its application
build. See [`db/README.md`](db/README.md) for existing-database adoption,
environment loading, and constraint-validation sequencing. Better Auth retains
its separate migration path.

Treat `SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` as production key material — back it up
separately; rotating it requires re-encrypting existing values.

## Google Workspace connection

OpenInstinct can use a user's Gmail, Calendar, and read-only Contacts through a
user-scoped Google OAuth grant. Vercel Connect stores and refreshes the tokens;
OpenInstinct stores only the stable user identity used to request them. Gmail
access deliberately uses `gmail.modify`, not the permanent-delete
`mail.google.com` scope.

1. In one Google Cloud project, configure the OAuth consent screen and enable
   the Gmail API, Google Calendar API, and People API.
2. Create OAuth web credentials. Add
   `https://connect.vercel.com/callback` as an authorized redirect URI, then
   download the client-secret JSON.
3. Vercel expects top-level `clientId` and `clientSecret` keys, not Google's
   nested `web.client_id` and `web.client_secret` download. Convert the download
   into a temporary file outside the repository, then create and attach the
   connector:

   ```bash
   vercel link
   google_credentials_file="$(mktemp)"
   jq '{clientId: .web.client_id, clientSecret: .web.client_secret}' /absolute/path/to/downloaded-client-secret.json > "$google_credentials_file"
   vercel connect create google --connection-method oauth --name open-instinct --data @"$google_credentials_file"
   rm -f "$google_credentials_file"
   vercel connect attach <returned-connector-uid> --project <your-vercel-project> --environment production --yes
   vercel env pull
   ```

   Never commit either credential file.

4. Set `GOOGLE_CONNECTOR_UID` to the returned UID and redeploy. The default is
   `google/open-instinct`.

Gotchas:

- Attach the connector separately to every Vercel environment that should use
  it. A production attachment does not make preview or local development work.
- `gmail.modify` is a sensitive scope, not a restricted one, so a Testing-mode
  app is not limited to the seven-day grant lifetime or the CASA security
  assessment that restricted scopes like `mail.google.com` trigger. Broader
  distribution (beyond listed test users) still requires Google's standard
  OAuth verification.
- The scopes requested here must also be declared on the Google consent screen.
  After changing scopes or enabled APIs, disconnect and reconnect the account so
  Google issues a grant with the new access.
- The grant is keyed to the authenticated OpenInstinct user. iMessage reaches
  the same grant only when its verified phone number maps to that Better Auth
  account.
- Google Contacts search uses a provider-side lazy cache, so a contact created
  moments ago may not appear immediately.
- Sending email always requires approval. Creating or updating a calendar
  event requires approval only when it carries attendees (Google emails them
  an invitation); events with no attendees run directly. Deleting a calendar
  event always requires approval, since it can cancel the event for existing
  attendees.

## Local development

Configure the variables in `.env.example`, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Merit-Systems/open-instinct.git
cd open-instinct
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Local development uses the same Postgres, vault, Kernel browser, and AI Gateway
path as the Vercel deployment — there is no separate local-only runtime.
